<h1>Bouldering App Project</h1>

<h2>Bouldering Dashboard:</h2>
<p>I want to start tracking successful attempts of bouldering routes at my local bouldering gym.</p>

<p>The user will be able to keep a record of their successful attempts and see how their friends are also progressing. The route's should also be selectable to find out more detailed information and those users who have completed it.</p>

<p>I must be able to input new successful attempts for a user which have an association with the record of the route.</p>

<h2>MVP:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create new users of the app (climbers).</li>
<li>Create a new bouldering route (routes).</li>
<li>Display a list of all climbers.</li>
<li>Display a list of routes.</li>
<li>View climbers and the routes they have successfully attempted.</li>
<li>View routes and the climbers who have successfully attempted them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Possible Extensions:</h2>
<ul>
<li>CRUD actions for the routes.</li>
<li>Display the hardest climb achieved by a climber.</li>
<li>Set a goal of difficulty level when achieved redirected to a congratulations page and prompted for a new goal.</li>
<li>Add a difficulty opinion to a route when a climber has successfully completed it for feedback to the bouldering gym        route setter.</li>
<li>Display routes where climbers feel they are easier/harder than route setter intended.</li>
<li>Add photographs of the routes which are an option to be shown in further details page?</li>
<li>Add groups of climbers.</li>
<li>Add leaderboard for climbers in group.</li>
<li>Add hidden field of tips from climbers who have managed route.</li>
</ul>
